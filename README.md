Introduction:

Welcome to our Motorbike Rental App! My application allows users to easily rent motorbikes for their transportation needs.
With a wide selection of motobikes and convenient booking options, we aim to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience for our customers.
Let's explore the three main components of my app.

User Interface Layer as GUI:

The User Interface Layer serves as the front-end of my Motorbike Rental App, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for customers to interact with.
Users can access various features and functionalities through a visually appealing and responsive interface. For example, they can browse through available motorbikes,
view their specifications and rental prices, select the desired rental duration, and proceed with the booking.

Business Logic Layer as BUS:

The Business Logic Layer acts as the brain of my Motorbike Rental App, handling all the business rules and processes.
It comprises a set of classes and components that manage motorbike inventory, bookings, pricing, availability, and user authentication.
For instance, this layer ensures that motorbikes are correctly assigned to users based on their bookings, calculates rental charges based on the chosen duration,
and handles user authentication and authorization. It also handles payment processing, generates invoices for completed rentals,
and manages any additional services such as helmet rental or insurance options.

Data Access Layer as DAO:

The Data Access Layer is responsible for interacting with the database and managing the persistence of data.
It includes classes and methods that communicate with the database to store and retrieve information related to motorbikes, users, bookings, and other relevant data.
This layer ensures the integrity and security of the data, allowing for efficient data retrieval and storage operations.
It also enables the app to generate reports and perform statistical analysis on rental trends and revenue, providing insights for business decision-making.

In conclusion, my Motorbike Rental App combines an intuitive user interface, robust business logic, and efficient data management to provide users with enjoyable motorbike rental experience.
